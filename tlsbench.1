.Sh NAME
.Nm tlsbench
.Nd Benchmarking of TLS/TCP connections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl \&Dl
.Op Fl j Ar jobs
.Op Fl w Ar secs
.Op Ar address
.Op Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility measures the establishment and termination of TLS and TCP connections.
Two instances have to be started.
One in server mode and the other in client mode.
The clients start a connection and initiates a TLS connection.
The server accepts connections, proceeds the TLS handshakes and terminates it
immediately.
The client prints out the number of connections per seconds.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Don't use TLS.
.It Fl l
Start
.Nm
in server mode and listens on
.Ar address
and
.Ar port .
Default
.Ar address
is 127.0.0.1
and
.Ar port
12345.
.It Fl j Ar jobs
.Ar jobs
is the number of parallel processes doing the measurement loop.
Default is 1.
.It Fl w Ar secs
Stop after
.Ar secs
seconds.
Default it 5.
